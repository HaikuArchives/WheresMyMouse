# Where's My Mouse?! v1.0

Where Is My Mouse is a little application that draws concentric circles around the mouse pointer. 

This can help with finding the cursor on the screen, which can be particularly useful during presentations.

## Usage

Use Haiku's Shortcuts preferences to set a key combination to it.

Just run it to see the effect.
To change settings like number of circles, their width and the speed of the animation, run WMM from the Terminal with the "-s" parameter. This will open a settings panel to adjust those visuals.
Settings are saved in ~/config/settings/WhereIsMyMouse_settings
