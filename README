Where Is My Mouse is a little application that draws concentric circles around the mouse pointer. This can help finding it on the screen, especially when doing a presentations with a projector or on a laptop ;]

A quick explanation:

Use Haiku's Shortcuts preferences to set a key combination to it. This will make WMM more functional ;]

Just run it to see the effect.
To change settings like number of circles, their width and the speed of the animation, run WMM from the Terminal with the "-s" parameter. This will open a settings panel to adjust those visuals.
Settings are saved in ~/config/settings/WhereIsMyMouse_settings


THX:

Technix  for idea, and Jeremy for great SpicyKeys.
mmu_man for idea to use B_TRANSPARENT_32_BIT as view color.

Axeld for telling me about beamers and laptops - where this app may be a little bit more useful than not at all ;]
